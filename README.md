# Building a loan default prediction model

This project involved using Logistic Regression to build a classification model that would predict whether a loan would default or not. I used the 2008 Q1 dataset from Fannie Mae, that can be found here: https://loanperformancedata.fanniemae.com/lppub/index.html
